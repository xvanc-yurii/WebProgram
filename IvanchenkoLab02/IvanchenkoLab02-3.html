            <p align="center">Hey, this is my <strong>homepage</strong>, so I have to say something about myself.
                Sometimes it is hard to
                introduce yourself <mark>because</mark> you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start
                with. Let me give a
                try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my
                <i>impression</i> about
                myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.
            </p>

            <p align="center">I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to
                do,
                to see, and to experience. I like to <b>read</b>, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I
                like to
                talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night;
                I
                like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the <u>ocean</u>. I like
                to look at
                the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the
                middle
                of the night. </p>
